                <li>Being my first software development internship, I learned a lot about technical standards and industry practices. Everything from comments to CI/CD on git!</li>
                <li>I worked on everything ranging from automation projects to reserve, use, and terminate GPU instances to fullstack development to implement new features!</li>
                <li>Within fullstack development, I was heavily involved in working with geospatial data. I was involved in the entire process -- from creating a more efficient storage solution to visualizing over 500,000+ data points dynamically, allowing for full user customization!</li>
                <li>Java Spring Boot, Vue JS, MongoDB, AWS RDS (SQL DB), S3</li>
